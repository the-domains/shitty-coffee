It's getting hot outside here in Toronto. 

To combat the heat lets do a spin on the classic iced-coffee. 

For this recipe you're going to need:

• enough iced cubes to fill your cup/mug

• 4 shots of espresso

• 2 oz. Irish cream liquor

• 4 oz. regular milk

Combine the Irish cream with milk and froth to 160\*F . 

Pull 4 shots of espresso. 

In a glass or tumbler, fill it with ice to the brim. using the back of a spoon slowly pour in the milk-liquor mixture slowly. 

Using the back of the spoon, pour the shots over the spoon into the glass/tumbler to make sure the shots sit on top of the milk. 

The ice will reduce from the heat of the heat of the liquids and you will have a fantastic mix to take down and enjoy.
