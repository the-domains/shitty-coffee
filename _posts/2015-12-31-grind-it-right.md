A coffee can be the best thing in the world. It can open up your day to the wondrous possibilities the universe holds or puts that once loose plan for the attack of the day move mentally into a strategic operation. This can also be a sad experience if one of the many moving parts of a great cuppa coffee isn't done right.

Today we're going to cover step one after opening the bag of beans. Yes, beans. We're not going to let that dude or dudette that sold you a pound of your favorite roast grind that shit down making those bits of brown gold loose not only their luster but the all important humidity that each bean holds. null

First, get you arse into a store that sells Burr quality grinders. Or if you're lazy and just want one, check out our store [here][0]. null

Here's the difference in grinds:

Coarse (Press) - These pin-head size coarse grinds will pull the aroma and oils out when steeped for 4 minutes in a French Press.

Medium (Cone/Basket) - Slightly finer grind will be great for having the hot water pour over and grab the coffee goodness out of the bean on it's way to your carafe or cup. 

Fine (Espresso) - Tiny grinds that compress well. This setting will have you making a coarse powder of the beans that's perfect for the espresso machine. 

Very Fine (Turkish) - This grind is so fine it's a silty powder that makes a coffee nice and thick. Almost close to instant when the powder is added to hot water yet can be filtered out when using a ultra-fine filter. 

So there you have it. The basics of grinding. 

Now what are you waiting for. Make another cup. null
